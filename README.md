### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jay

I'm a software engineer based in Brooklyn, NY with extensive experience in JavaScript and Ruby and proficiency in TypeScript, Go, and various frameworks.


I bring business context and customer empathy to my work from experience on the business side of several startups in e-commerce, predictive analytics, and performance marketing. I have partnered with product and engineering leaders and customers.

Most recently, I created [Arbiter](https://arbiter-framework.com), an open-source, cloud-native framework that seamlessly integrates video conferencing into existing web applications</p>
